# Group-4-Project - Quinn Shim, David Ding

# Running Clean
Have a folder at the same directory level as this repository called `Data`. In `Data`, have `county-statistics.csv`, `mask-use-by-county.csv`, and `us-counties.csv`.

Then, enter this repository and run `python3 clean.py`

# Notes on Cleaning

Cleaning gets the raw data, then reformats each dataframe to have only necessary columns. This includes casting data into similar data types and renaming columns. The county election statistics do not have a `fips` field and their `state` column was just abbreviations, so we had to map the states of a dictionary of {state names : abbreviations} to allow the data to be merged via county-state pairs.

Other notes on cleaning can be found in comments in the code.
